Foxkeeper

== Description ==

What did firefox do to your settings/extensions/bookmarks/etc. *this* time?
If only you had your firefox profile in revision control, you would know
exactly what changed... and be able to change it back!

== Features ==

Foxkeeper preserves your settings, bookmarks, etc. in case firefox eats them!
You can go back to the way firefox was when you last exited it, or the time
before, back to when you first started using Foxkeeper.

Additionally, many firefox extensions don't make much noise when they download
and install updates.  It's hard to know that it has even happened, with a few
exceptions.  Even less common is any obvious indication of what actually changed.

Not only can Foxkeeper let you know that something has changed, if you feel
*especially* motivated, you can review those changes yourself.  Git's standard
GUI is used, allowing you to pick and choose which changes you'd like to keep,
and which to omit.  (By default, all the changes that firefox has made are
staged, so you can just hit 'commit' and be okay).

If you have the Copious Free Time and know what to look for, Foxkeeper could
even help prevent you from being the victim of a nefarious plugin!

== Requirements ==

You need Firefox (any relatively recent version should do) and Ruby 1.9
installed.

Rubygems: 

* parseconfig, to read firefox's profiles.ini file.

Other programs:

* The sqlite3 program (not just libraries) installed.

== Installation/Setup ==

Note: Presently, Foxkeeper is only tested under Linux.  These instructions
should get easier over time as the project develops.

First, add the foxkeeper directory to your $PATH, so it can find its auxiliary
ruby scripts.  You may also need to change the paths at the top of the ruby
scripts if necessary, to properly execute them with Ruby 1.9.

In your ~/.mozilla/firefox directory, you will have directories for each
profile, and a 'Crash Reports' directory.  In the profile directories you
want to use foxkeeper on, run the following commands:

$ git init
$ echo "Cache/*" > .gitignore
$ sqlite-filter-install.rb
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Initial firefox settings"

Now that the setup is done, you should be able to run foxkeeper, like so:

$ foxkeeper

This will first run gitk to show you what has changed, then run firefox for
you, then after firefox exits run 'git gui' for you.

If you don't usually use the terminal, you may want to edit firefox's ".desktop"
file in your distribution to run foxkeeper instead of firefox.

== Implementation notes ==

In order to make the best use of space, and to better show you what has
actually changed, a major goal of this project is to avoid committing binary
blobs to the git repository.  To that end, each binary file will be serialized
to an appropriate text format representing the data in that file.  For example,
a large number of files used by firefox are SQLite databases, which can be
dumped by SQLite itself to the SQL necessary to recreate it.

Unfortunately, some security-related files are in an ancient Berkeley DB
format.  An ffi binding to the relevant code from the NSS module is forthcoming,
to serialize these files to an appropriate text format.

Suggestions and patches are welcome!
